<h2>Include your description of what happened in the public database</h2>
<p>When you submit a complaint through the CFPB, you can choose to authorize us to include your description of what happened in the Consumer Complaint Database. Providing or withdrawing your authorization will not affect how your complaint is handled.</p>
<p>Prior to publication, we use a series of automated and manual reviews to remove personal information from the content of your description, such as names, addresses, and account numbers. The information that would be scrubbed out of a complaint is highlighted in the following example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXAMPLE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We  monitor this process to ensure that all personal information is removed, but a small risk remains that something will be missed. The process of removing personal information takes time, so your description wonâ€™t appear in the database right away.</p>
<p>If you authorize publication but change your mind, you can withdraw your authorization at any time  by calling the CFPB help line at (855) 411-2372. Your description will then be removed the next time the database is updated.</p>
