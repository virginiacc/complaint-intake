We took out a private education loan for our daughter <span class="redacted-text">XXXXXX</span> while she was attending the <span class="redacted-text">XXXXXX</span> University in <span class="redacted-text">XXXXXX</span>, MA. Our daughter\’s social security number is <span class="redacted-text">XXX</span>-<span class="redacted-text">XX</span>-<span class="redacted-text">XXXX</span>. This loan went into default after she transferred to a community college in <span class="redacted-text">XXXXXX</span>, MA. Our lender received notice that she was no longer a full-time student in <span class="redacted-text">XX</span>/<span class="redacted-text">XX</span>/2011. Then our younger son <span class="redacted-text">XXXXXXX</span> became very sick and we could no longer make the monthly payments on our daughter\’s loan. We tried to set up a new payment plan to get us back on track, but the servicer won’t negotiate. We\'ve been paying what we can but we still haven\'t reduced any of the principal on the loan.
